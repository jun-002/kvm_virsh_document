1. Rescan SCSI hosts:

# for host in 'ls /sys/class/scsi_host'
do 
	echo ${host}; echo "- - -" > /sys/class/scsi_host/${host}/scan
done

2. Issue LIP to FC hosts:
# for host in 'ls /sys/class/fc_host'
do 
	echo ${host}; echo "1" > /sys/class/fc_host/${host}/issue_lip;
done

3. Run rescan script from sg3_utils:
# rescan-scsi-bus.sh

# rescan-scsi-bus.sh -i

Reload/Refresh Multipathd deamon
After above scan, the new assigned LUNs are visible in Linux OS level, but still multipathd daemon will show no mappings for new LUNs. You will have to refresh multipathd daemon to map the new LUNs.

Run the below command:

# multipath -v2

Verify
Verify with “multipath -ll“” that the LUNs are visible now.

# multipath -ll
